# EX 51 C program to reverse a string.
## AIM:
To write a C program to reverse a string.

## Algorithm
1. Read the input string from the user.
2. Find the length of the string.
3. Use a loop to swap characters starting from the beginning and end moving towards the center.
4. Continue swapping until the middle of the string is reached.
5. Print the reversed string.
  

## Program:
```
